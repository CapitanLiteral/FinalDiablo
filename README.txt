Welcome to Diablo 2 Rise of Diablo

Introduction of the Game:
The main character, the barbarian, starts in hell where he has just defeated Diablo and has 
stolen the stone he had on his head. The barbarian has just put the stolen stone on his head 
and a powerful demon recognises him as the new evil lord. But he’s too weak and needs evil to 
get more power. To do that he has to go to the normal world and conquer cities and villages.

When our barbarian gets enough evil, he will transform into a monster, half human being and 
half demon. His name will be “The Butcher”. The more evil will be needed to become the evil lord.

At last when he achieves enough evil, he will transform into the evil lord, Diablo, the final 
demon. Now Diablo is able to get its maximum power versus the human beings, at the cost that 
he will never be a human being again.
